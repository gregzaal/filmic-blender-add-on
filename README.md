# Filmic Blender Add-on

[**Download me :)**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregzaal/filmic-blender-add-on/master/filmic_blender.py) (Right click, Save As)

All this add-on does is add a button to let you download and install Filmic Blender from [Troy's GitHub](https://github.com/sobotka/filmic-blender) automatically.

If you already have Filmic Blender installed, the button won't even show up. Useful for:

- making sure all workstations in an office environment have it installed
- or if you do not know how to copy paste ;)

The existing `colormanagement` folder will be renamed to `colormanagement_old` just in case.

If you ever want to update Filmic Blender, just press *Spacebar* and search for *Get Filmic Blender*.
